    <br><strong>Applied Econometrics and Data Analysis (Undergraduate Level)</strong>
    <br>Extends students' earlier coursework to theoretically develop more advanced econometric tools, study their application in scientific research, and apply them to data. Topics include advanced regression analysis, limited dependent variables, nonparametric methods, and new methods for causal inference, among others.
    <br>
    <br><strong>The Science of Population (Undergraduate Level)</strong>
    <br>Explores how to measure and understand the forces that shape human population and its interaction with the social, economic, and natural environments. Emphasizes hands-on analysis of demographic data using statistical programming. Applications focus on differences between the past and present, between rich and poor countries, and between racial and ethnic groups within the US.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Macroeconomics of Development (PhD Level)</strong>
    <br>Explores topics in economic growth and development, with attention to aggregate phenomena. Topics include development accounting, misallocation, structural transformation, consumption over the lifecycle, human capital, population, and long-run growth.

    <br><strong>Critical Perspectives on Global Health and Health Policy (Undergraduate Level)</strong>
    <br>Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, knowledge and values at work in the field of global health, and explores the environmental, social, political, and economic factors that shape patterns and variations in disease and health across societies. Topics include: technology and public health; development and the governance of disease; human rights and social justice; the shifting role of states, civil society, and public-private partnerships in health care delivery. Students are encouraged to think creatively about health problems and to envision innovative and effective interventions.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Development Economics (PhD Level)</strong>
    <br>Explores topics in economic growth and development. The first half of the course covers primarily microeconomic themes, including consumption, human resources, population, and environment. The second half has a more macroeconomic focus, with topics including the determinants of cross-country income differences and long-run growth.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Econometrics for Policymakers: Advanced (Master's Level)</strong>
    <br>Discusses the main tools of econometric analysis, and the way in which they are applied to a range of problems in social science. Emphasis is on using techniques, and on understanding and critically assessing others' use of them. There is a great deal of practical work on the computer using a range of data from around the world. Topics include regression analysis, with a focus on regression as a tool for analyzing non-experimental data, discrete choice, and an introduction to time-series analysis. Prerequisite: 507c.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Health Economics (PhD Level)</strong>
    <br>Examines health issues in both developed and developing countries. Specific topics include the evolution of health over the life course; the fetal origins hypothesis; the two-way links between socioeconomic status and health; the impact of social safety nets on health outcomes; environmental threats to children's health and development; health insurance and its effects on health; and the relationship between health and economic growth.
